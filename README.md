# Getting set up

## Initial pages setup

Copying from [Github Pages instructions](https://pages.github.com)

- Create a repository (username.github.io for your username project)

- Clone the repo

- `echo "Hello World" > index.html`

- Commit and push changes

- Check the result in username.github.io

## Adding a theme

Using the instructions from [Cayman Theme instructions](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman?tab=readme-ov-file) added in the \_config.yml file and pointed to a theme. And from [this old blog post](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) you can actually add any theme

- Wasn't picking up theme, changed index.html to index.md

## Adding a layout to modify header

First attempt, followed description in Jekyll docs but this overrode the theme completely. Needed to copy in the layouts used by the Cayman theme and then modify them where needed to show themed page.

Needing a bit of minor tweaking to get all lined up, but fairly straightforward.

## Updated blog link

For now linking to external blog before settings things up in pages.
