# Getting set up

## Initial pages setup

Copying from [Github Pages instructions](https://pages.github.com)

- Create a repository (username.github.io for your username project)

- Clone the repo

- `echo "Hello World" > index.html`

- Commit and push changes

- Check the result in username.github.io

## Adding a theme

Using the instructions from [Cayman Theme instructions](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman?tab=readme-ov-file) added in the \_config.yml file and pointed to a theme. And from [this old blog post](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) you can actually add any theme

- Wasn't picking up theme, changed index.html to index.md
